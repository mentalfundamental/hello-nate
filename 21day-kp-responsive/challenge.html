      <header><h1>American Wirehair Cat</h1></header>
        <p class="section-desc">Intelligent and highly adaptable, the American Wirehair is an American original, with a completely unique wired coat.</p>
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>The American Wirehair is distinguished from other breeds by her wiry, dense coat, described as feeling like steel wool or lamb’s wool. There are several degrees of wiriness, varying from spiked to curly, with the individual hairs being crimped, hooked or bent. The ideal Wirehair coat is dense, coarse and crimped over the whole body (including the whiskers). This coat is unique, and not genetically related to the rexed coats of Cornish Rex or Devon Rex cats.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
