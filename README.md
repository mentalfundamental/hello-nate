# hello-nate

This repository is built as an extension of my *Software Engineering* journey - and maybe some aspects of my personal life. 

This will and should serve as an outlet for my creativity, wild ideas, brain farts, and more.

If you have anything to say, you can best reach me here: nate.corpuz01@gmail.com

Carry on
